When your Project is Opened, you will see an Interface for creating apps called Designer. Where it has Component Platte at Left an Android Device Mockup at Center and a Properties tab at Right along with some Buttons in the top menu.<br><br>Now you can use the components from Palette and drag them to Mockup Screen to add then in your app and use Properties tab to change look/properties of the component. You can also add External Files like Images, Fonts, Pdf, Json, Etc. By Clicking on the Upload Button below the Components tab.<br><br>Now, by clicking on the Blocks button we will go the to blocks Section i.e the logical part of your App, where you will use blocks to perform Action on Event, Execute Procedures and more.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://blogs.xyberneo.com/media/posts/3/Kt9SYyGjWVIAFZd6GeSPt9e3K3FHnPtKzinDRfp73Dm7UsXTMi2IFMdsJg0Cj8KzykvXcUw_b4HVqmtDrWTvf1x1W83TnJGv82bLV28l0IqHAkBllm1Szm6W5qFJ-6-rAs2048.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.xyberneo.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Kt9SYyGjWVIAFZd6GeSPt9e3K3FHnPtKzinDRfp73Dm7UsXTMi2IFMdsJg0Cj8KzykvXcUw_b4HVqmtDrWTvf1x1W83TnJGv82bLV28l0IqHAkBllm1Szm6W5qFJ-6-rAs2048-xs.png 300w ,https://blogs.xyberneo.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Kt9SYyGjWVIAFZd6GeSPt9e3K3FHnPtKzinDRfp73Dm7UsXTMi2IFMdsJg0Cj8KzykvXcUw_b4HVqmtDrWTvf1x1W83TnJGv82bLV28l0IqHAkBllm1Szm6W5qFJ-6-rAs2048-sm.png 480w ,https://blogs.xyberneo.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Kt9SYyGjWVIAFZd6GeSPt9e3K3FHnPtKzinDRfp73Dm7UsXTMi2IFMdsJg0Cj8KzykvXcUw_b4HVqmtDrWTvf1x1W83TnJGv82bLV28l0IqHAkBllm1Szm6W5qFJ-6-rAs2048-md.png 768w ,https://blogs.xyberneo.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Kt9SYyGjWVIAFZd6GeSPt9e3K3FHnPtKzinDRfp73Dm7UsXTMi2IFMdsJg0Cj8KzykvXcUw_b4HVqmtDrWTvf1x1W83TnJGv82bLV28l0IqHAkBllm1Szm6W5qFJ-6-rAs2048-lg.png 1024w ,https://blogs.xyberneo.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Kt9SYyGjWVIAFZd6GeSPt9e3K3FHnPtKzinDRfp73Dm7UsXTMi2IFMdsJg0Cj8KzykvXcUw_b4HVqmtDrWTvf1x1W83TnJGv82bLV28l0IqHAkBllm1Szm6W5qFJ-6-rAs2048-xl.png 1360w ,https://blogs.xyberneo.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Kt9SYyGjWVIAFZd6GeSPt9e3K3FHnPtKzinDRfp73Dm7UsXTMi2IFMdsJg0Cj8KzykvXcUw_b4HVqmtDrWTvf1x1W83TnJGv82bLV28l0IqHAkBllm1Szm6W5qFJ-6-rAs2048-2xl.png 1600w\"  height=\"576\" width=\"975\" alt=\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    As mentioned before App Inventor is an Open Source software, so you can make your own app inventor.<br><br>For personal use, it can be hosted on your PC, or hosted on a cloud platform as App Inventor is.<br><br>App Inventor's Code and related Information can be found in their <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources\" target=\"_blank\">Github Repository</a><br><br><br><br>There are many App Inventor Clone also known as App Inventor Distributions. App Inventor distributions are same as AI2 but with different themes &amp; tweaks. They are kind of commercial version so you will see may differents components in then except that one in AI2. The extra components are very useful. You can also monetize your application by using ads components which are present there and many more...<br><br><br><br>As these distros provide you many different things along with the basic app inventor, you will have to pay them. Most of them have a monthly/early subscription. But some works on different model get paid. For Example. Kodular is completely free of cost, you will have to pay $0 to use it. But if you want to monetize your app, then kodular will take some part of ads and display their ads as a part of commission based revenue system. This commission can be removed by paying a monthly fee.  <br><br>Similarly Niotron has a different type of model to generate revenue from their service. This builder is <strong>not recommended</strong> for people who want a dedicated support team and fellow users to interact with in the community. Moreover, there is no way you can monetize your app without paying for it<br><br> Some of the known Distros are :<br><br>1. Appy Builder (Was merged with kodular)<br><br>2. Thunkable<br><br>3.
